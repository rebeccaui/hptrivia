# Harry Potter Trivia Game
  
  In this trivia game, my objective was to create a quiz that allows the user 30 seconds to answer each question, displays the correct answer and a response after each question for 5 seconds, and gives the user a wizarding rank at the end of the game according to their score.
  
  The game uses javascript features to create timers that listen to the user responses and each other. It also uses jQuery to dynamically display data across several arrays in a synchronous fashion. The greatest challenge I faced in creating this application was taking the game rules step-by-step from a userâ€™s perspective in order to properly synchronize all the different aspects of the game. 

Please enjoy!
